# Braindead OS
## The OS with a dead brain!

Written in the most loved language **RUST**

Currently it barely has any features.

In order to run it make sure you have rust (I recommend download it using rustup) and qemu,
then just type cargo run in the braindead_os directory after you have cloned the repo.
If everything runs according to plan cargo should download all dependencies and run the OS in qemu.
